    <p class="strong">The Reporting Procedure for all six rules is the same. Find an AllMid Staffer and make them aware of the situation. They are instructed to immediately escalate the issue to show security and show management.</p>

    <p class="strong">At least one building manager and two building staffers (one male one female) will be present all hours of the  event. One UCPD officer will be on premises at the evening.</p>

    <h2>Weapons Check Policies</h2>
    <p>All prop weapons brought to the show MUST be approved as soon as you arrive. We will be looking for the following criteria:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It cannot fire any sort of projectile. (Nerf guns are only allowed if they have been deactivated and cannot fire.)</li>
        <li>It cannot be an airsoft weapon. (Yes, even if it’s deactivated.)</li>
        <li>It cannot be sharp or pointy enough to cut or pierce someone with moderate pressure. This includes all real swords, daggers and knives. It also includes ceramic blades, needles, syringes and anything that can pierce (for example, a Little Sister syringe made of wood would not be allowed)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Upon approval, your weapon and badge will be tagged and cataloged.</p>

    <h2>Event Floor Policies</h2>
    <p>For safety reasons, the following are not allowed to be used specifically inside the Event Space:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Strollers (they may be carried)</li>
        <li>Stilts</li>
        <li>Remote controlled vehicles</li>
        <li>Rollerskates, rollerblades, skateboards, and other forms of recreational wheeled transport</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Given the crowd density, situations that require mass egress would be restricted by these devices.</p>
